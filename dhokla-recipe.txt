Ingredients:
2 cups Gram flour (besan), sieved (this step is imp.)
1 cup Yogurt, beaten
to taste Salt
1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder
1 teaspoon Green chilli-ginger paste
2 tablespoons oil
1 tablespoon Lemon juice
1 teaspoon Soda bicarbonate
1 teaspoon Mustard seeds
2 tablespoons Fresh coriander leaves, chopped
1/2 cup Coconut, scraped
1tsp ( available in indian grocery stores) Eco fruit salt


Directions:
Take gram flour in a bowl. Add yogurt and approximately one cup of warm water and mix. Avoid lumps. Add salt and mix again. Leave it aside to ferment for two to three hours. When gram flour mixture has fermented, add turmeric powder and green chilli-ginger paste. Mix well. Heat the steamer. Grease a thali with 1tsp of oil. In a small bowl take lemon juice, soda bicarbonate, one teaspoon of oil and mix. Add it to the batter and whisk briskly. Pour batter into the greased thali and place it in the steamer. [Just before pouring the batter into the greased thali you can add eco powder without water]. Cover with the lid and steam for ten minutes. You can also cook this mixture in a pressure cooker without the whistle. When a little cool, cut into squares and keep in a serving bowl/plate. To make outstanding dhoklas apply tamarind chutney over dhokla and spread with help of spatula. Then spread coriander chutney and tomato chutney. (I always follow this step and all my friends and family love dhoklas prepared by me) Heat the remaining oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds. When the seeds start to crackle, then add 2tsp. of hing, break 3-4 red chillies(whole) lastly add 3-4 tsp of desiccated coconut. Remove from heat and pour over the dhoklas. Serve, garnished with chopped coriander leaves. Tip: To make moist dhokla in a serving dish add cold water and sugar syrup (10-12tsp). Then place your dhokla. And rest same as above. After completing the preparation store the dhoklas in fridge for 1 hour.
